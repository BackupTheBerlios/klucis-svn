/**
 * Issues:
 * (2) Code could be shorter and more consistent, if 
 * whole widgets/components would be passed to the template
 * (rather than individual properties)
 * 
 * (3) Could do hasComponent-type components as 
 * an interface (or abstract class), which would
 * allow to center any component on top of any other one. 
 * 

 * <h3>Tasks for students</h3>
 * 
 * <ul> 
 * <li>Use SVG refid mechanism; do not repeat same path etc. construct many times;
 * add component id's to the comments of SVG output to make debugging easier</li>
 * <li>More sophisticated box container, which allows allign/distribute commands. 
 * </ul>
