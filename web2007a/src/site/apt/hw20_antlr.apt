~~~~

    [Goal:]
    Use Antlr parser generator to deal with a custom non-XML markup.

    [Description:]
    Process a subset of LaTeX expressions of mathematical formulae
    in order to create their MathML representation. 
    For example, convert <<<\frac{2}{3}>>> (fraction 2/3) into 
    a MathML notation.
