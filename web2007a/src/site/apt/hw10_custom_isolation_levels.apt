Homework 10: Custom isolation levels
~~~~

    [Description:]
    Implement a Spring application having a transactional 
    behavior describable by custom isolation levels, i.e. 
    make a runnable example out of this article:
    {{http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-isolation/index.html}}    
    In parallel, implement also 
    EJB 3.0 stateless session bean application with 
    similar behavior.
